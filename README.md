FinRoute

Finroute is an application to solve the travelling salesman problem. Every day each delivery boy/girl working in a courier company faces the problem of finding the best route or most efficient way to reach all of his/her destinations using an optimized or least costly route.
This app is a solution to this problem where the courier service / delivery person enters his/her locations into the application and the app comes up with the best route. The entry of locations can be done dynamically by other means as well.
